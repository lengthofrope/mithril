### Security

- **XSS prevention** — Markdown preview now sanitized with DOMPurify before DOM injection via `x-html`
- **Mass assignment hardening** — Removed `user_id` from `$fillable` on all 12 models; `BelongsToUser` trait handles ownership automatically
- **AutoSaveController blocklist** — Fields `id`, `user_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at` can no longer be auto-saved
- **Bulk update field whitelist** — `bulkUpdate` endpoint now only accepts explicitly allowed fields (status, priority, team, member, group, category, deadline, privacy)
- **Import sanitization** — Import rows are now filtered against model `$fillable`, with `id` and `user_id` stripped before insertion
- **IDOR prevention** — All `exists:` validation rules scoped to authenticated user via `Rule::exists()->where('user_id', ...)`
- **Password change protection** — Settings page now requires current password when changing password (`required_with:password`)
- **Avatar upload hardening** — Restricted to `jpeg`, `png`, `webp` MIME types (blocks SVG with embedded scripts)
